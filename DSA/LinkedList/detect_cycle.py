# To determine if a linked list has a cycle, a common approach is to use the Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare algorithm.
# This algorithm uses two pointers, a slow pointer (the tortoise) and a fast pointer (the hare).
# The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time.
# If there's a cycle in the list, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer; otherwise, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list (null).
